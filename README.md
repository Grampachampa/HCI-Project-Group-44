# Group 44 Group Project - TrvCvlt Music App

## üìù How to Set up
Step 1: download and isntall [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

Step 2: Clone this repository onto your machine

Step 3: In the newly cloned folder, open a terminal prompt and run the following commands
```sh
npm install
npm install -g expo-cli
```
Step 4: Download the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app on your smartphone. If the link here does not work, look it up on the store relevant to your platform (it is free). Create an account and log in

Step 5: Now, you should have everything you need to run the app.

## üöÄ How to Run
Step 1: in the terminal window open to the folder that you cloned to your machine, run the following command:
```sh
expo-cli start --tunnel                    
```
Step 2: This should cause a QR code to appear in your terminal. Scan it in the Expo Go app (if on Android), or just with your normal camera and follow the link (if on iOS). 

*NOTE: YOUR DEVICE HAS TO BE ON THE SAME NETWORK AS THE MACHINE RUNNING THE CODE FOR THIS STEP TO WORK

Step 3: The App will start loading on your mobile device! Do not worry if it takes a minute or two to load in for the first time. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Troubleshooting
- If the app doesn't load within the first 2 or 3 minutes of you loading attempting to open it up, shake your devide (this opens a developer menu) and press the reload button
- If the app is stuck at 100% loaded, reload the app in the same manner
- Icons can be slow to load in - especially the first time. This is normal, and is not the fault of your mobile device
- If you have installation problems (or issues running the software), feel free to contact gtoup 44 via university email or telephone number (+358 40 324 7317)

## üìå Current limitations
#### Due to time and budget limitations, the app has a number of limitations. To avoid confusion for the user, the most prominent are listed below
- likes on songs are not transferred between pages, except for the search page and the "liked playlist", where the songs are unique from all of the other pages
- The messages, profile customization, and settings opetions are not functional
- The "Liked songs" playlist is the only functional one

We at group 44 sincerely thank you for putting the time and effort into looking through and grading our project and related assignments!
